    <h1>Rhine–Taft Telepathic Reading Study (1972)</h1>
    <p>
      A field archive of summaries, correspondences, and sample materials from an experiment
      conducted between 1972–1975, exploring whether brief exposure to written passages could
      facilitate information transfer between minds. Reports describe sporadic, unpredictable
      outcomes in which participants shared details after reading only the first paragraph of selected texts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Study sessions took place in quiet rooms with single readers. The task was to skim a short passage,
      take note of any strong impression, and write a brief line about it. Some sessions showed no link at all,
      while a few showed overlap in recall of a single word after only a small amount of reading.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Choose any article below and skim the <strong>first paragraph</strong>. If a <em>big</em> word stands out, keep it in mind.
