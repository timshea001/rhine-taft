        In 1972 a small team ran a set of tests. Notes list time, room, and a word that felt odd to them.
        Numerous logs say a clear beat ran throughout the text. The same signs came up constantly.
        The staff saw clear advantages in short runs. It was recommended that each read stay short and plain.
        When a word felt different, they would mark it. On some occasions a link was suggested.
        In such sets the task went more effectively.

        Most runs gave no odd data. A few runs did. In those, a lone word felt as if the page had a pull to it.
        Numerous notes mark the same feel. A trail seems to run throughout sets that use calm light and no talk.
        Teams kept the space constantly still. That gave small but real advantages.
        Use of one page was often recommended. A swap to card work was not, as that was too different.
        At rare occasions a test line was suggested to check drift. When it hit, it did so effectively.

        Work went on for a short span. Numerous gaps stay in the file. Yet a thin path shows up throughout the notes.
        Logs say that a short read helps. It is constantly tied to a calm mind and a clear aim.
        The team wrote up advantages and set a plan that was recommended for new help.
        Pick one word that feels different. If that fails, wait for later occasions. Try again when rest is suggested.
        When it lands, the mind sync shows more effectively.
