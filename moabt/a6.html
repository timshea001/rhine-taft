        Brief framing lines were read to some readers prior to the page, while others had no prep at all. The aim was to see if a hint or prime could nudge a reader toward a line that fits the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logs note that prep lines can steer recall, yet the same lines also add noise. The memo here lists prep text, room notes, and small charts, with care to keep the stance neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prep lines were kept short. Many drafts were tried. A simple hint worked better than a long lead-in.
        Readers who heard the hint wrote lines that matched the frame during most runs. Those with no prep gave more varied replies.
        Staff noted these trends always. The gains of a hint were clear, but so were the risks.
        The plan called for hints to be used with care. A varied kind of prep might work, but a short cue tested best.
        On some days no hint was tried as a control. That method proved to work well for baseline data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kind of hint mattered. Many types were tried. A hint about mood worked well. A hint about a scene or image also worked.
        A hint that was too vague did not help during the test. Readers said they felt lost or unsure.
        A hint that was too sharp steered them too much. Staff aimed always for a middle path.
        Such balance gave real gains. The plan called for all hints be tested first on a small group.
        A varied hint might fit a varied text. On rare days a bold hint was used.
        That approach worked well only when the text was dense or hard to parse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timing was also key. Many runs tried varied gaps between the hint and the read. A short gap worked best.
        If the hint came too early, readers forgot it during the test. If it came right before, it stayed fresh.
        Staff logged time always to track this. The gains of a short gap were clear.
        The plan called for hints to be given no more than a minute before the read. A varied timing might serve a varied goal.
        On some days a long gap was tried to see if the hint would fade. That test proved the point well: short gaps win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noise was a real issue. Many readers with hints gave lines that felt forced or fake. They wrote what they thought they should write, not what they felt.
        Such bias showed up during the forms. Staff had to sort through this noise always.
        The gains of hints were real, but the cost was high. The plan called for hints to be used only when the goal called for it.
        A varied setup, with no hints at all, gave cleaner data. On rare days a hint was tried to test a weak reader.
        That method worked well in a few cases, but it was not the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control runs were crucial. Many runs with no hint were done side by side with hint runs. This let staff see the varied outcomes.
        Hint runs gave more focused lines, but less variety overall. No-hint runs gave more scatter, but also more surprise.
        Staff weighed these trade-offs always. The gains of control runs were clear.
        The plan called for all hint tests include a no-hint group. A varied design might miss this key point.
        On some days a mixed setup was used, with half the group getting hints. That method worked well and gave the best data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The memo ends with a balanced view. Many finds show that hints can shape recall, but they also add bias.
        The data is clear during: hints work, but they come with a cost. Staff kept the tone neutral and the claims modest.
        The plan called for any new team test hints with care. Do not assume they are always good or always bad.
        A varied context might call for a varied choice. On rare days a strong hint was tried for a specific test.
        For most work, light hints or no hints work well. The goal is clean data, not forced results.
