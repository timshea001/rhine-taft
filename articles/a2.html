        This note surveys a small set of lab sessions in which small teams read the same text in quiet rooms. The plan was simple: skim a short page, pause, and write a brief line about any strong image or idea. Meters on the desk logged heart rate and brain wave bands, while a clerk kept time and room logs.

        Raw logs show long spans with no clear link at all. In a few runs, wave peaks lined up for a short time, yet the gap in sample size blocks any grand claim. The data packet in this file keeps the tone plain: note the room, the hour, the page, and the line the reader wrote. That is all.
