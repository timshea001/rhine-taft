        Letters in this box are short and crisp. They talk about room setup, staff time, and what to cut from the plan. One note asks if a card test should sit next to a text trial, or if the mix muddies the flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later mail drops the card idea and keeps the text run. The close shows a plan for a small fund drive and a list of lab needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first letter is from early 1972. Dr. Rhine writes to Dr. Taft about the plan. He says that many tests have been run with cards.
        The data is good, but it does not show the full picture. He thinks that text might work better during a long study.
        Readers can write what they feel, not just pick from five cards. Such freedom gives real gains.
        The plan called for Taft to set up a small trial. A varied method might be tried later, but text should come first.
        On some days Rhine suggests that card tests be used as a control. That idea is noted but not yet acted on well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taft writes back with questions. Many points need to be worked out. How long should each text be? What kind of room works best?
        Should readers be alone, or should they sit in a group during the test? Rhine replies with care.
        He says that short text works well. A page or less is best. Rooms should be quiet and calm, with no noise.
        Readers should work alone, at least at first. Such rules give clear gains. The plan called for Taft to follow these guidelines closely.
        A varied setup might be tried later, but start simple. On rare days Taft asks if music or dim light might help.
        Rhine says no. Keep it plain. That method works well.
      </p>
      <p>
        One letter talks about staff. Many people are needed to run the tests. Who will log the data? Who will check the forms?
        Taft says that he can hire two or three staff, but not more. Rhine says that is fine. Keep the team small during the study.
        Too many staff can add noise. A small team stays focused. Such focus gives real gains.
        The plan called for each staff member have a clear role. A varied plan, with tasks spread too thin, will not work.
        On some days Rhine suggests that staff swap roles to check for bias. That step is noted as a good idea and is tried well later.
      </p>

        Money is a constant worry. Many letters talk about funding. Taft asks how much the study will cost.
        Rhine gives a rough sum. It is not huge, but it is not small. Rooms, staff, forms, and time all add up during the year.
        Taft says that he can find some money, but not all. He asks if Rhine can help. Rhine says that he will try.
        Such talks show the real challenges of the work. The gains of the method are clear, but the cost is real too.
        The plan called for both men work on a fund drive. A varied source of money might be found.
        On rare days a grant from a big group is tried. That step is tried, but it does not work well. The money comes from small donors in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The card test debate comes up again. Many letters go back and forth. Taft asks if cards should be part of the plan.
        Rhine says that cards have been done many times. The data is good, but it is old. Text is new and worth a try during this study.
        Taft agrees but asks if a small card run might be used as a check. Rhine says that it might muddy the flow.
        Keep the focus on text. Such a choice gives clear gains. The plan called for cards to be set aside for now.
        A varied study might use both, but not this one. On some days Taft pushes back, but Rhine holds firm.
        In the end, text wins. That choice proves to work well, and the card idea is dropped.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last letter is a plan. Many steps are laid out. Taft will set up rooms by the end of the month.
        He will hire staff and print forms. Rhine will send sample text and help with the first few runs.
        Both men agree that the work should start small and grow during the year. Such a plan gives real gains.
        The plan called for them to meet in person once the setup is done. A varied timeline might be faster, but slow and steady is best.
        On rare days Rhine suggests a bold push to get data fast. Taft says no. Take time to do it right.
        That choice proves wise. The work starts well, and the study becomes a model for later teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        The box of letters ends here. Many small talks led to a big plan. The tone is calm, careful, and honest overall.
        Both men know the work is hard and the data may not come. Yet they try. Such effort gives real gains to the field.
        The plan called for these letters be kept and shared. They show how good work starts: with clear talk, modest goals, and honest doubts.
        A varied approach might hide the struggle, but that would not serve the truth. On rare days a letter hints at hope or excitement.
        Most of the time, the tone is sober. That is how science works well, one small step at a time.
