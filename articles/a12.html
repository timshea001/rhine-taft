        Funds ran low, staff moved on, and the last box of notes went to a store room. What stays is a set of short pages, time logs, and spare charts that show a slow, honest try at a hard line of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The close of the file asks that any new team keep the same care: neat rooms, short tasks, and clear forms. That is the end of the archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end came slowly. Many signs showed up over time. First, the grant money ran out. Staff had hoped for a renewal, but it did not come.
        Such a loss made the work hard during the final year. Rooms had to be shared. Gear went without repair.
        Staff worked always to keep the tests going, but the strain showed. The gains of a full budget were clear in its absence.
        The plan called for any new team secure funding for at least three years. A varied plan, with short grants, does not give time to build good data.
        On rare days a small grant was tried as a bridge. That step helped, but it was not enough. The work needs steady money to work well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staff began to leave. Many people had been with the study from the start. They knew the method and the rooms.
        When they left, the team lost that knowledge during the final months. New staff came in, but they had to learn from scratch.
        Such a gap slowed the work. The gains of a stable team were clear. The plan called for any new team plan for staff to stay long term.
        A varied model, with high turnover, does not serve the work. On some days a new staff member brought fresh ideas.
        That was good, but the loss of deep knowledge was hard. The method works well only when the team knows it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data from the final runs was thin. Many tests gave weak results. Staff think this was due to the strain and the loss of focus.
        The rooms were not as calm. The gear was not as reliable. Such changes showed up during the last logs.
        The gains of a strong start were lost in a rough close. The plan called for any new team avoid this trap.
        Do not let the work drag on when the support is gone. A varied choice might be to pause and wait for better times.
        On rare days a team pushed through a hard patch and came out strong. This team did not. The data from the end should be taken with care.
      </p>
      <p>
        The archive was packed up with care. Many boxes went to a quiet room in the basement. Forms, logs, charts, and notes were all kept.
        Staff hoped that someone might want to review the work during the years to come. Such hope gave the team a reason to keep good records.
        The gains of a tidy archive are real. The plan called for all notes be filed and labeled.
        A varied approach might lose the data to dust and time. On some days a lab closed and threw out all the old files.
        That is a loss to the field. This team did the right thing. The archive stands as a record of what was tried, even if it did not fully work well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone of the final memo is sober. Many goals were set, and some were met. A few runs gave clear data. A few readers showed real links.
        Yet the full picture is mixed overall. The work did not prove the method beyond doubt. It showed that the method can work, but only under the right conditions.
        Such honesty gave real gains to the field. The plan called for any new team read these notes and learn from what went wrong as well as what went right.
        A varied team might do better. On rare days a great breakthrough was hoped for. That did not come.
        For now, the work stands as a modest step. That is enough. Science moves well one small step at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final note is a plea. Many teams will try this work in the years to come. The team asks that they keep the same care and honesty.
        Do not hype the data. Do not hide the failures. Show the full picture overall. Such truth serves the field.
        The gains of honest work are real and lasting. The plan called for all teams make their data public, warts and all.
        A varied path, with only the good runs shown, does not help. On some days a team might want to polish the story.
        Resist that urge. The truth works well as a guide. Use these notes as a map of what to do and what to avoid. The archive is here for that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last line is simple. Many people gave time and effort to this work. The data is thin, but the try was real.
        What stays is a record of that try. The method may work in other hands, or it may not. Time will tell.
        For now, the archive rests in a quiet room, waiting for someone to open the boxes and try again. Such is the way of science.
        The gains of this work are not in grand claims, but in the slow, honest push to know more. The plan called for the next team start here and build on what was learned.
        A varied path might ignore this work, but that would be a loss. On rare days a new team finds a better way.
        That is the hope. For now, the work is done. The file is closed. The method stands as it is, and it has worked well to the extent that it could.
