        In 1972 a small team ran a set of tests. Notes list time, room, and a word that felt odd to them.
        Many logs say a clear beat ran across the text. The same signs came up often.
        The staff saw clear benefits in short runs. It was advised that each read stay short and plain.
        When a word felt varied, they would mark it. On some times a link was proposed.
        In such sets the task went more well.

        Most runs gave no odd data. A few runs did. In those, a lone word felt as if the page had a pull to it.
        Many notes mark the same feel. A trail seems to run across sets that use calm light and no talk.
        Teams kept the space often still. That gave small but real benefits.
        Use of one page was often advised. A swap to card work was not, as that was too varied.
        At rare times a test line was proposed to check drift. When it hit, it did so well.

        Work went on for a short span. Many gaps stay in the file. Yet a thin path shows up across the notes.
        Logs say that a short read helps. It is often tied to a calm mind and a clear aim.
        The team wrote up benefits and set a plan that was advised for new help.
        Pick one word that feels varied. If that fails, wait for later times. Try again when rest is proposed.
        When it lands, the mind sync shows more well.
